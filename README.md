# .github Repository

Welcome to the `.github` repository for **GDG UEM Kolkata**! This repository contains community health files, configuration files, and an organization-wide profile README. Here’s a quick overview of what this repository includes and how it works.

## Purpose of the `.github` Repository

The `.github` repository is a special repository used to store files that are visible across all repositories within our organization. This helps provide a consistent, organization-wide experience for contributors and visitors. Here’s what you might find here:

- **Organization Profile README** (`profile/README.md`): This README file appears on the main page of our organization on GitHub, providing visitors with an overview of who we are and what we do.
- **Community Health Files** (`ISSUE_TEMPLATE`, `PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE`, `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`): These files apply to all repositories in our organization by default, helping to streamline our contribution guidelines and processes.

## What’s Inside

- **profile/README.md**: This file is displayed as the README on our organization’s GitHub page. It provides an introduction to our organization, our mission, and links to key projects.
- **CONTRIBUTING.md**: Guidelines for contributing to our projects.
- **CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md**: Code of Conduct for contributors, outlining the expected behavior within our community.
- **ISSUE_TEMPLATE/**: Templates for creating issues, ensuring consistency in reporting bugs or suggesting new features.
- **PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md**: Template for pull requests, helping contributors provide all necessary information when making contributions.

## How to Contribute to the `.github` Repository

If you want to update any of the files here or suggest improvements, feel free to open a pull request. Make sure to follow our [Contribution Guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md) and adhere to our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Why Use a `.github` Repository?

By centralizing these files in a `.github` repository, we can:

- Provide a unified, consistent experience for contributors across all our repositories.
- Reduce redundancy by avoiding the need to copy templates into each repository.
- Make it easier to manage and update community guidelines across the organization.

We’re always open to feedback and suggestions to improve the experience for our contributors, so please don’t hesitate to reach out or open an issue if you have any ideas!
